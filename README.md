<p>Bookwise is a website to share your rating about a book that you read. Besides, you can search for books based on their category, see your profile statistics, last ratings, popular books, and other features.</p>
<p>In this project, I learned and practiced a lot of NextJS features, like SSR and SSG. Furthermore, other technologies and libraries were used, like NextAuth for authentication using OAuth 2.0, Prisma ORM, MYSQL Database, React Query, Axios, ZOD, React Hook Form and others.</p>

The Home page shows the latest book reviews sent by users registered on the platform, as well as the most popular books.

### 2. Explore all books based on each category

The Explore page shows all books based on each category available in the database. By clicking on a certain book, its detailed information appears. Additionally, you can write down a rating for the book selected and send it.
